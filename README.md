Node based procedural texture generator for unity.

Overview https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtvFIBPRkxc

Tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmczC67Dyo8



Uses a somewhat modified copy of https://github.com/Seneral/Node_Editor_Framework  taken about July 2016

Textures generated by this tool are free from any license and can be used commercially/sold.

The Software is currently in open beta before eventually going on the asset store.

I look forward to seeing what an artist can create with it and am looking for examples to share.. and Subroutines to add (fully credited to creator)

The code has been tested on a Windows 10 PC running Unity 2017.3.1 with a 4GB GPU (rx470)

The source code provided is MIT open source, but it does require a shader downloaded at runtime that is not open source and is CopyRight (c) Michael Diskett 2016-2018, All Rights Reserved.
